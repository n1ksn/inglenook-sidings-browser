In order to call local web workers in InglenookSidingsThreaded.html you
must either run it in a browser set up as a local server or do the
following:

- In Firefox, go to about:config and set the following flag to "false":

      security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy

- In Chrome, start it with the command line option

      --allow-file-access-from-files


To set up a local server, go to the folder holding the file and web
worker and enter

  > python3 -m http.server

and open a browser at the address returned (e.g., 0.0.0.0:8000).

In Windows you may need to install python3 and use the same command
but without the "3" at the end of "python".

Setting up a local server is the only way to use this program with
Microsoft Edge.
